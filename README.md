# Squiggle Keyboard

It's a keyboard family which based on my circumstances, preferences, and
observed usages.

Requirements:

- 5 columns per hand.
  My right pinky is almost useless.
- At most 3 keys for each side's thumb row.
  My right thumb key is almost useless.
- No numrow.
  It's harder and more cumbersome to use than a numpad on a layer.
- Split.
  Typing on single flat keyboard hurts my arms in a lot of use cases.
- Symmetric.
  Personal preferences.

This family keyboard repo will not have any of the following features:

- OLED Screen: useless.
- LEDs: useless for me and hurt my eyes.
- Rotary Encoder: useless for me.
- Hotswap: I need a commitment.
- Case for `Low Profile`: defeating the whole purpose of ***LOW*** profile.
